  <h2>India ranks third in the world for highest number of terrorist incidents</h2>

  <div id="container1" class="container">
    <!-- ********************************************************************************** -->
    <p>India ranks 3rd in the world, in the number of terrorist incidents that occurred in 2017, according to the latest release of the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a>.</p>
    <p>The GTD shows Iran and Afghanistan as the only countries having a greater number of terrorist incidents in 2017 than India. India has had more terrorist incidents than Nigeria which is known to have major terrorist attacks by the Islamist group
      <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13809501">Boko Haram</a> that is still active and has been since 2002 and Syria who is in a state of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26116868">civil war</a> and where the terrorist
      organization Islamic State or <a href="https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-history-of-isis">ISIS</a> as it is commonly known is still active.</p>
    <p>India also has more terrorist attacks than <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-shares-names-of-20-terror-groups-with-pakistan-report/article19968362.ece">Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15336689">Somalia</a>      all of whom have active terrorist groups based in their countries and <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/history-of-conflict-in-yemen-2017-12?r=US&IR=T">Yemen</a> which is also in a state of civil war.</p>

    <div id="bar-graph" class="dataviz">

    </div>
    <p>India has been consistently in the top ten countries, for the total number of terrorist attacks, for straight thirty years since 1987.</p>
    <p>GTD records zero terrorist incidents that happened in India in 1970. Since then India has shown a rise in the number of terrorist incidents and in 2017, India witnessed a total of 966 terrorist attacks.</p>
    <p>The GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970. The latest release was in early August this year where data until 2017 was compiled. The database is maintained by researchers at the National
      Consortium for the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/">Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)</a>, headquartered at the University of Maryland.</p>
    <p>According to their <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/">website</a>, a terrorist incidence is defined as, "The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or
      social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."</p>

    <p>The first spike in terrorist incidents in India was in 1984 when India witnessed 159 terrorist incidents, two-thirds of which were in Punjab and carried out by Sikh extremists and the Dishmish Regiment as they wanted independence for the state of
      Punjab and wanted a separate nation of <a href="https://www.thequint.com/explainers/khalistan-golden-temple-operation-bluestar-anniversary">Khalistan</a>.</p>
    <p>The Sikh extremists were responsible for the maximum number of terrorist incidents (for which the organization responsible was known) from 1984 until 1992 and were responsible for more than half of the number of terrorist incidents. The number of
      terrorist incidents remained above 300 from 1988 to 1991.</p>
    <p>The state of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html">Jammu & Kashmir has been in conflict</a> since India won independence in 1947. The state, having a Muslim majority and a Hindu king, decided
      to remain neutral and not accede to either India or Pakistan. Various events later led to the Kashmir part of the state, to be divided between the two countries.</p>
    <p>As a result, the state has been in a continuous state of conflict giving rise to many separatist organizations that are also religiously inspired by Islam.</p>
    <p>Forty-four percent of the total number of terrorist incidents from 1995 to 2000 happened in Kashmir and were mostly carried out by the separatists.</p>
    <p>In the first five years after 2000, the number of terrorist incidents exceeded 200 only in 2001.</p>
    <p>Apart from the Islamic separatists in Kashmir like <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/lashkar_e_toiba.htm">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/hizbul_mujahideen.htm">Hizbul Mujahideen</a>, and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/95">Jaish-e-Mohammad</a>, there were a number of separatist movements that started in the North Eastern states of Tripura, Assam, and Nagaland as well.</p>
    <div id="line-graph" class="dataviz">

    </div>
    <p>The north-east like Kashmir has seen a lot of separatist movements. Many of these conflicts, with distinct aims and objectives, have persisted despite the intervention of state and civil society. Dialogues with the militant outfits have had
      very less success in achieving ceasefires in this region.</p>
    <p>India was the country with the highest number of terrorist incidents from 2000 to 2003. In 2000, there were 180 terrorist incidents and since then the number of terrorist incidents have increased by more than five times in 2017.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/04/india-maoist-rebels-explainer-170426132812114.html">Naxalite insurgency</a> originated in Naxalbari which is a town in the state of West Bengal in Eastern India. India nearly wiped out
      the movement during counterinsurgency efforts in the 1970s that left the group broken into smaller factions, including the People’s War Group and Maoist Communist Center. In 2004, these two groups aligned to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist).</p>
    <p>In 2008 there was a rise of 258% in terrorist incidents from the previous year. Out of the 534 incidents, 130 were by Communist Party of India – Maoist (CPI-M).</p>
    <p>Since then the CPI-M has been attributed with the greatest number of the attacks in India and has been a major threat to the national security.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/the-general-in-charge-of-the-surgical-strikes/20170926.htm">Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda</a> is the former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Indian army’s Northern Command. “The problem of the Maoists,
      the insurgencies in Northeast and the proxy war in Kashmir continues to date. Therefore, you are seeing a large number of terrorist incidents.” said Lt. Gen. Hooda when asked why India faces such a huge number of terrorist incidents, “Ever since
      independence, India has faced many internal conflicts. Starting in the 1950s, we saw insurgencies in Nagaland and Mizoram, followed by Manipur. Thereafter, Tripura, Assam, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. We also have an ongoing conflict with the Maoists.”</p>
    <p>He explained how the circumstances in the 19th century resulted in conflicts. “The success of the Southeast Asian countries in gaining independence, and particularly the Malay and Vietnam examples, where armed struggles had led to independence, was
      a motivating factor in the initiation of insurgencies in Nagaland and Mizoram.</p>
    <p>“Jammu & Kashmir has evolved into a hybrid conflict that is fueled by numerous factors including support from Pakistan, increasing radicalization and a clash of ethnicities.”</p>
