  <h2>Number of Deaths per Terrorist Incident have gone down from 2.4 to 0.6 as compared to the previous decade</h2>

  <div id="container1" class="container">
    <!-- ********************************************************************************** -->
    <p>Fewer people are dying in terrorist incidents, in India in the 2010s, as compared to the previous decade, according to the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a>.</p>
    <p>The deaths per terrorist incident from the years 2000 to 2009 was 2.4. The same ratio, for terrorist incidents from 2010 to 2017 is at 0.6, which shows a fall of 1.8 deaths from the previous decade.</p>
    <p>There was a total of 6,148 deaths as a result of the terrorist incidents in India during the 2000s, averaging 615 deaths per year. From 2010, this figure has dropped to 481.</p>
    <p>The number of deaths caused by terrorist incidents dropped drastically from 2010 to 2012 and went down from 812 to 264, but the number of terrorist incidents reduced by only 72.</p>
    <p>Since 1979, the year 2010 was the last one to have the number of deaths per incident above one. After that, this ratio has always been below one.</p>
    <p class="note note2">Note: The death count for 220 terrorist incidents of the 11,960 that have happened in India since 1970 to 2017, were not available and have not been considered in this analysis.</p>
    <p>The GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970. The latest release was in early August this year, where data until 2017 was compiled. The database is maintained by researchers at the National
      Consortium for the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/">Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)</a>, headquartered at the University of Maryland.</p>
    <p>Among the top ten countries, that witnessed the highest number of terrorist incidents, in 2017, India had the lowest rate of deaths per attack. The other nine countries had an average of 2.8 deaths per attack, whereas in India, the ratio was 0.5.</p>
    <p>“There is a large number of terrorist groups but many are seeking political recognition and so their attacks are not aimed at killing people”, according to the Institute of Economics and Peace <a href="https://lnt.ma/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/global-terrorism-index-2017.pdf">report</a>      in 2017. “This discrepancy between the number of attacks and deaths reflects how the nature of terrorism in India differs when compared to other countries.”</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/the-general-in-charge-of-the-surgical-strikes/20170926.htm">Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda</a> is the former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Indian army’s Northern Command and also a visiting fellow at
      <a href="http://www.claws.in/">Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS)</a>, an autonomous think tank on strategic studies and land warfare, in an Indian context.</p>
    <p>“The problem of the Maoists, the insurgencies in Northeast and the proxy war in Kashmir continues to date. Therefore, you are seeing a large number of terrorist incidents.” said Lt. Gen. Hooda when asked why India faces such a huge number of terrorist
      attacks, “However, it must also be noted that while the number of incidents is high, the total number of people killed or injured in these attacks is relatively low. This is one measure of the success of the security forces.”</p>
    <p>Out of the total terrorist incidents recorded for India in the GTD since 1970 to 2017, 55% of the incidents had zero fatalities. And since 2010, more than 70% of these terrorist incidents occurred without anyone getting killed.</p>
    <p>Terrorist organizations, responsible for 20 or more incidents in the 2010s, had an average of 0.9 deaths per terrorist incident.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/cpi_m.htm">Communist Party of India – Maoist (CPI-M)</a> and the Maoists were responsible for 2,651 incidents killing 2,228 people from 2010 to 2017. There were 0.8 deaths per
      incident. CPI-M had 0.6 deaths per incident and the Maoists had a ratio of 1.1.</p>
    <p>The CPI-M and the Maoists have been active mostly in the states of Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Orissa, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh (Telangana was included in this list as it was a part of Andhra Pradesh until 2014), essentially
      the central and eastern parts of India.</p>
    <p>In these eight states (which includes Telangana) the death to incident ratio was 0.8 in the 2010s, as compared to the 2000s, when it was 2.7. The highest ratio, among these states, in the current decade was in Maharashtra with 1.1 deaths per incident.</p>
    <div id="bubble" class="dataviz">

    </div>
    <p>At the state level, Jammu & Kashmir has had the highest number of deaths and the highest number of incidents since 1970. There have been more than 4,000 deaths in almost 2,500 terrorist incidents in the state. The state, since India won independence,
      has always been politically disputed between India and Pakistan and as a result has always been in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html">conflict</a>. </p>
    <p>This conflict has led to the formation of several militant separatist organizations, which in-turn, has led to a great number of terrorist incidents in the state. There have been around 1.7 deaths per incident in the state of Jammu & Kashmir since
      1970. Since 2010, the death to incident ratio is 0.6.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/lashkar_e_toiba.htm">Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)</a>, an organization which is mostly active in Kashmir, was responsible for 2.4 deaths per incident in the 2010s. This
      is 1.5 more deaths than the average of the organizations that were responsible for 20 or more incidents.</p>
    <p>The north-eastern states have seen a lot of nationalist/sub-nationalist movements over the years. This has led to the start of several violent movements in this area. The states in the North-East include Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
      Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, and Sikkim.</p>
    <p>The number of deaths per incident in these states decreased, and went down to 0.4 in the 2010s as compared to the previous decade, when it was 1.9.</p>
    <p>The deadliest of these separatist organizations, in this decade, was the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/ndfb.htm">National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)</a> which was responsible for 149
      deaths, with a 1.4 death to incident ratio.</p>
