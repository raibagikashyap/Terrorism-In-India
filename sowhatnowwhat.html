  <h2>India has witnessed terrorist incidents 88% of the days during the BJP rule</h2>

  <div id="container5" class="container">
    <p>India witnessed at least one terrorist incident a day for almost nine out of ten times, since the <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</a> government came in power in May 2014, until the end of 2017, according to the <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a>.</p>
    <p>India has witnessed at least one terrorist incident a day on 1,159 occasions out of a total of 1,316 days, during the period from May 2014 (when the BJP came into power) until December 2017 (which is until when the data in GTD is available), which is 88% of the total number of days.</p>
    <p>The current government of BJP came to power on May 26, 2014. The manifesto of BJP declared ‘zero tolerance’ for terrorist activities. The manifesto stated, ‘Over the past decade, lack of a strong and visionary leadership, coupled with multiple power centers, has failed to address the issue of national security, leading to a chaotic situation and denting India's image in the international arena.’</p>
    <p>However, in the period of ten years, when the government was led by <a href="https://www.inc.in/en">Indian National Congress (INC)</a>, India witnessed at least one terrorist incident on 57% of the days.</p>
    <p>There has been a total of 3,336 terrorist incidents since the BJP government took over, which is 2.5 terrorist incidents per day as compared to the Congress-led government when India witnessed 1.3 terrorist incidents per day during the decade that they were in power.</p>

    <p>The number of terrorist incidents in 2015 increased to 884 from 860 in the previous year. India faced a total of 1,025 terrorist attacks in the year 2016 and 966 in 2017.</p>
    <p>In no year since 1970 (which is when the GTD is maintained from), the number of terrorist incidents was more than 800, before 2014.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.claws.in/">Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS)</a> is an autonomous think tank in Delhi that works on strategic studies and land warfare in the Indian context. CLAWS conducted a seminar on Challenges to Statecraft in Non-Military Realm on 13th July 2016. They summarized the seminar into a <a href="http://www.claws.in/images/events/pdf/1068184357_Executive_Summary_and_Detailed_Report_-_Terrorism_in_India_(1).pdf">report</a> which stated how terrorist incidents affect India in various ways. According to this report, India suffers politically, culturally as well as economically to a great extent as a result of so many terrorist incidents.</p>
    <p>The terrorism in the country challenges its social and cultural harmony and hence has created distrust among various communities also resulting in more communal riots. While armed insurgencies seek to achieve political power, terrorism by itself seeks to destroy societies, social cohesion and the way of life.</p>
    <p>On an economic level, terrorism has resulted in forcible and voluntary displacement, changes in occupation and increased government expenditure on displaced persons. Terrorism in India has also resulted in the loss of business, tourism and manufacturing activity and investment into new industries and solation of the affected areas. Terrorism has impacted the quality delivery, sustainability of development activities and systematic erosion of the credibility of the systems of delivery and governance.</p>
    <p>The direct cost essentially involves the direct destruction from a terrorist attack. For instance, when a study was conducted in the period 1992-2005, it was found that in 5,300 terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, approximately 1,300 government buildings, 800 educational buildings and 3,000 shops were destroyed.</p>
    <p>India is a successful democratic state and the Indian state recognizes the space for accommodating the diversity. However, failure of politics has resulted in the existence of prolonged violence in terrorist and insurgent affected areas. This has affected governance in India, thereby reducing the function of the Indian state in those areas.</p>
    <p>According to the summary of <a href="http://ramachandraguha.in/">Dr. Ramachandra Guha’s</a> inaugural speech during the seminar, “In spite of the great challenges that India faces as a nation as a young country, given its size, diversity, poverty, India has done moderately well. However, India should not be complacent about this, especially in regards to inter-religious harmony. Indian pluralism is a fragile project. India exists as a nation because of its founding fathers who made sure that whatever Pakistan does to its minorities, even if Pakistan becomes an Islamic state, India will not become a majority religion state.”</p>
    <p>However, in the 1,316 days that the current government has been in power till 2017, there have been 1 to 5 terrorist incidents on 1,065 of them. There were 6 to 10 terrorist incidents during 84 of these days and more than 10 attacks on ten occasions.</p>

    <p><a href="https://feminisminindia.com/2016/12/19/interview-isha-khandelwal-jagdalpur-legal-aid-bastar/"></a>Isha Khandelwal is a human rights lawyers and co-founder of the <a href="http://www.jaglag.org/about-us/">Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group (JagLAG)</a>, an organization which provides free legal aid to Adivasi people in Bastar, which is a hot-bead of the Maoist movement.</p>
    <p>Ms. Khandelwal questions the entire approach of the government to tackle extremist activities in Bastar.</p>
    <p>“So, let’s see what the government is doing. Is that working at all? Is militarizing the place working? No, it is not.”, says Ms. Khandelwal, “Not giving people’s rights, like diluting <a href="https://fra.org.in/">Forest Right’s Act (FRA)</a> and <a href="http://pesadarpan.gov.in/en_US/rules">Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA)</a>. Especially the current government has further <a href="https://scroll.in/article/871191/from-compulsory-consent-to-no-consultation-how-the-government-diluted-adivasi-rights-to-forestlands">diluted the Forest Right’s Act</a> so that industrialists can come in.”</p>
    <p>“Whose development are we talking about at the end of the day?” asks Ms. Khandelwal as she questions the ‘development model’ of the current government, “Are we talking about the people? Can you force development on somebody? Can you force the burden of the development of the country on your indigenous population that they have to pay the price for me being able to get the luxuries sitting here?</p>
    <p>“The state doesn’t have public transport and the government comes in and builds an airport in Jagdalpur. Why does Narendra Modi come and inaugurate this airport in Bastar, saying that the Adivasis are now going to travel in flights? I am sorry, you are so far from reality. Because you don’t have public transport, people are not even able to take buses because they are so expensive.”</p>
    <p>According to a <a href="http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1529169">press release</a> by the <a href="https://mha.gov.in/">Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)</a> in April 2018, “Over the last four years, there has been a substantial improvement in the Left-wing extremism (LWE) scenario. Incidents of violence have seen a 20% decline with a 34% reduction in related deaths in 2017 as compared to 2013. The geographical spread of LWE violence also shrunk from 76 districts in 2013 to just 58 districts in 2017. Besides, just 30 of these districts account for 90% of the LWE violence in the country. At the same time, certain new districts have emerged as the focus of expansion by the Left-wing Extremists.”</p>
    <p>However, Ms. Khandelwal questions if this translates to progress, “I don’t know if according to you that is a progress if Maoists are decreasing. I don’t know what the definition of progress is. Or what is anybody’s definition of progress? Look at what’s happening in those areas. Are people there getting access to adequate health care and education or are things better for people? Just getting rid of Maoists, is that progress for the country?”</p>
    <p><a href="https://idsa.in/profile/rdahiya">Brig Rumel Dahiya</a>, is the Deputy Director General at the Institute of Defense Studies & Analyses. He has an MSc and MPhil in Defense and Security Studies. In his paper <a href="https://idsa.in/policybrief/EnsuringPeaceinNortheast_rdahiya_110615">Ensuring Peace in the Northeast</a>, he says, “The internal security situation in the North-eastern states is complex. It requires people with in-depth knowledge of the terrain, society, politics and culture and history of insurgency in the region to be placed in positions entrusted with the handling of affairs.</p>
    <p>“Frequent change of interlocutors, for example between Naga groups and Government of India, would not be desirable since delicate negotiations require a great degree of trust between negotiators and that can only come about with longevity of engagement.</p>
    <p>“Investments in the region are required for the economic advancement of the people. These would require the creation of a peaceful environment in the North-eastern states.”</p>
    <p>The Government of India announced a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/govt-signs-peace-accord-with-nscnim-pm-narendra-modi-says-historic/">landmark deal</a> that was signed in August 2015 between the Government and National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Isak-Muivah (NSCN – IM).</p>
    <p>As for Kashmir, experts don’t agree on the best course of action to take when it comes to tackling the threat from separatist organizations.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.orfonline.org/contributors/prem-mahadevan/">Prem Mahadevan</a>, a senior researcher with the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, suggests through his <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-global-discourse-state-sponsored-terrorism/">paper</a> that, “a more militarily offensive posture against Pakistan needs to be adopted, with the job of diplomats and scholars being to create a discursive space that emphasizes the necessity of such an approach.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Mahadevan argues in his paper that, “the only time when India has totally defeated Pakistan was when it went on the offensive.” He says, “Most importantly, there needs to be a clear effort to link the territory of Pakistan with the notion of terrorist safe havens. This can happen after more <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/army-conducted-surgical-strikes-on-terror-launch-pads-on-loc-significant-casualties-caused-dgmo/articleshow/54579855.cms">surgical strikes</a> such as those which occurred on 29 September 2016 against terrorist launch pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.</p>
    <p>“Indian diplomats, scholars and journalists need to start building up a case for cross-border strikes on the Pakistani army and its jihadist proxies, as a matter of priority. Then, when the next <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/26-11/timeline/2611-mumbai-terror-attacks-heres-what-happened-at-taj-mahal-hotel-trident-oberoi-nariman-house/">Mumbai-type attack</a> occurs, India will be ready to do what is needed.”</p>
    <p>Asked whether India should be more on the offensive to curb the violence in Kashmir, <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/the-general-in-charge-of-the-surgical-strikes/20170926.htm">Lt. Gen. DS Hooda</a> who is the former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Indian army’s Northern Command, and was the General in-charge during the ‘surgical strike’ in September 2016 said, “Being offensive is too generalized a statement to adopt as a strategy. A much more sophisticated approach is required. Obviously, terrorists have to be tackled with a heavy hand and there is a need to restore law and order to get stone-pelting youth off the streets. However, a purely offensive strategy will be counter-productive.”</p>
    <p>Lt. Gen. Hooda, who retired in November 2016, thinks that the Kashmir issue needs to be handled delicately. He said, “The winning of hearts and minds of the population is essential to get them to see the futility of supporting militancy. There have to be schemes for youth engagement, provision of employment opportunities and a good rehabilitation scheme for those who wish to lay down arms and return to the mainstream,”</p>
    <p>He also believes that there is a key difference in fighting terrorism in Kashmir as compared to tackling Left-wing extremism and the nationalist movements in the northeast. He said, “The key difference is that J&K is an important border state that has been the bone of contention between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has been actively supporting and encouraging terror activities in J&K. This kind of transnational support is not available in the Northeast and to LWE. Therefore, tackling terrorism in J&K has two key components – first, take actions to minimize Pakistan’s support and second tackle the internal dimensions. Therefore, a lot of the Indian Army’s effort goes into border management to ensure that infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan is reduced to the minimum.”</p>
    <p>Different types of terrorist organizations are active in several states. The <a href="http://www.claws.in/images/events/pdf/1068184357_Executive_Summary_and_Detailed_Report_-_Terrorism_in_India_(1).pdf">CLAWS report</a> tries to point out a fundamental issue in the counter-terrorism approach of India. According to the report, “It is assumed that everything in law and order is a state subject and therefore, the State Police is the main actor in maintaining law and order in a state. India does not have institutions in place to deal with terrorism or such other issues that can be directly tackled by the central government.</p>
    <p>“India does not have institutions such as the Department of Homeland of the United States, which gives a holistic view of the main internal security challenges. So, India has a situation where a Chief Minister (CM) (Bihar) of a state can say he does not have a problem as far as Maoist scourge is concerned. On the contrary, such CM says that his concerns are related to development – building roads, schools, hospitals and the like. But Bihar has witnessed terrorist incidents from the Maoists in the current decade.”</p>
